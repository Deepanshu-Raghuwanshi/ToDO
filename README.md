api: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

you have to fetch the data from the api
 and show the data in a list

create a input field to get todo from the user
create a button to add todo in the previous list

add a delete button with every todo so that user can delete that particular todo

add a edit button with every todo so that user can edit that particular todo

make sure new data will  store  in same format as you get from api

like this
{
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "delectus aut autem",
    "completed": false
  },

you have to compelete this task with the help of redux
